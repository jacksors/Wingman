## Inspiration
We were inspired by travel companion apps that incorporate social networking, flight review systems, and travel planning help, but unfortunately we discovered that most of these apps are separate from one another. Our mission is to create the ultimate all-in-one travel companion.

## What it does
Wingman revolutionizes travel planning by integrating itinerary creation with a comprehensive review and communication platform. Users can effortlessly craft their travel schedules and access a wealth of information tailored to their specific journey. This platform offers:

1. Personalized Itinerary Building: Easily construct detailed travel plans, including flights and airport stays.
2. In-Depth Reviews and Ratings: Access user-generated reviews for every airport and aircraft on your itinerary, ensuring informed decisions about your travel choices.
3. Real-Time Chat Feature: Engage in live discussions with fellow travelers. Share experiences or seek advice about airports, airlines, and in-flight services.

By merging itinerary management with a robust review and communication system, Wingman offers a singular, user-friendly platform that alleviates the all-too-common stresses of air travel and gives its users the confidence to get excited about travel again.

## How we built it
We began developing Wingman by creating a development pipeline to streamline development and collaboration. Wingman was built using Next.JS, Postgres SQL, Prisma, Git, and deployed to Heroku. 

## Challenges we ran into
The most challenging part of building our application was managing the many objects that an application such as Wingman requires. Wingman requires keeping track of users, airlines, flights, aircraft, and chat messages to name a few of them, and all of these mesh together in interesting ways.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Weâ€™re extremely proud to have a functioning application that anyone can visit right now at [flywithwingman.com](https://flywithwingman.com) .

## What we learned
We learned a ton of the 24 hours of developing Wingman, from using ORMs like Prisma to frontend development in NextJS's React environment; this developing Wing project covered a lot.

## What's next for Wingman
Next, for Wingman's development, we'd like to implement more planning features, including reserving restaurants, optimizing travel time, and finding activites in the are you're traveling to.
